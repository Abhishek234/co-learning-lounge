<details>
 <summary> How to decide if the given problem can be solved with Machine learning or not?</summary>
    A machine learning problem consists of three things: <br>
    1. There exists a pattern. <br>
    2. You cannot solve it mathematically (even by writing exponential equations). <br>
    3. You have data on it. <br>
    Always look for these three factors to decide if machine learning is a tool to solve a particular problem.

## Questions on ML algorithms:

<details>
 <summary>Define linear regression?</summary>
   It is used to estimate real values (cost of houses, number of calls, total sales etc.) based on continuous variable(s). Here, we establish relationship between independent and dependent variables by fitting a best line. This best fit line is known as regression line and represented by a linear equation Y= a *X + b.<br>
   Y = Dependant variable, X = Independent variable<br>
   Types: <br> 
   - Simple Linear Regression: one independent variable <br>
   - Multiple Linear Regression: multiple (more than 1) independent variables <br>

 <summary>Define logistic Regression?</summary>
   It's classification algorithm, It is used to estimate discrete values [probability/confidence of occurrence of an event]( Binary values like 0/1, yes/no, true/false ) based on given set of independent variable(s). <br>

 <summary>What is  decision Tree?</summary>
    Decision tree is supervised learning algorithm - used for classification problems(works for both categorical and continuous dependent variables) <br>
    In this algorithm, we split the population into two or more homogeneous sets. This is done based on most significant attributes/ independent variables to make as distinct groups as possible. Decision tree algorithm is known to work best to detect non â€“ linear interactions. <br>
